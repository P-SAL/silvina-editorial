=== SESSION: Dec 13, 2025 - v0.4 Reference Class ===

MILESTONE: First OOP class for Silvina - Reference class working!

COMPLETED:
- Created silvina_editorial_v0.4.py
- Built Reference class with:
  * __init__ stores citation text
  * validate_author() checks format
  * validate_year() checks format
  * is_valid() combines all checks
  * get_validation_report() returns detailed results
- Tested with 7 different references
- All validations working correctly

LEARNED:
- How to create a class with __init__
- self references the current object instance
- Objects carry their own data
- Methods operate on object's own data
- Testing shows: 5/7 validated correctly

KEY INSIGHT:
OOP makes code cleaner:
- v0.3: validate_author_pattern(text) - pass data
- v0.4: reference.validate_author() - object knows its data

WORKING:
- Multiple authors with "y"
- Compound surnames (Pérez-Sánchez)
- Spanish characters (á, é, ñ)
- Year extraction from (YYYY)

NEXT SESSION:
- Build Document class (loads from Word)
- Build APAValidator class (validation rules)
- Integrate all classes together
- Start NEW CHAT with updated course prompt

THINKPAD: C:\00 PY\Course - venv312 active
STATUS: Reference class complete, committed to GitHub

=== SESSION: Dec 19, 2025 - v0.4 Reference Class Testing ===

COMPLETED:
- Successfully tested Reference class on ThinkPad
- Validated with 7 different references (5 valid, 2 invalid)
- Regex patterns working perfectly:
  * Multiple authors with "y"
  * Compound surnames (Pérez-Sánchez)
  * Spanish characters (á, é, ñ)
  * Year extraction from (YYYY)
- Committed v0.4 Reference class to GitHub

LEARNED:
- OOP in practice - objects carry their own data
- Each Reference validates itself
- Methods like validate_author() work on self.text
- get_validation_report() returns structured data

WORKING ON THINKPAD:
- Location: C:\00 PY\Course\silvina-editorial
- venv312 active and working
- Git synced with GitHub

ISSUES RESOLVED:
- VS Code Explorer not showing files → Fixed by opening folder with "code ."
- daily_log.txt visibility → Was in wrong directory

NEXT SESSION:
- Build Document class (loads from Word)
- Build APAValidator class (validation rules)
- Start NEW CHAT with updated course prompt

STATUS: Reference class complete ✅, ready for Document class


Dec 24, 2025 - v0.4 COMPLETE
- ✅ Document class: loads Word files, extracts Referencias section

- Focus: MUST HAVE features only for v1.0
- v2.0: Positioned as ambitious expansion project

🎯 v1.0 MUST HAVE FEATURES (Confirmed):
1. Article type detection (divulgación/científica)
2. Character count validation by type
3. Spanish APA 7 author validation (complete rules)
4. "et al." handling (3+ authors)
5. Organizational authors with acronyms
6. Multiple authors with "y" not "&"
7. References alphabetical order check
8. DOI/URL presence validation
9. Spanish quote validation « »
10. Duplicate reference detection
11. **Bibliography vs. References detection** (NEW - critical for EUMIC)
12. LLM grammar/style review
13. Comprehensive Spanish EUMIC-format report

📚 KEY DOCUMENTS FOR v0.5+:
- EUMIC Editorial Guidelines (Normas de edición EUMIC 2026)
- APA 7 Spanish Guide (Guía Normas APA 7ma edición)

🎓 LEARNING OUTCOMES (v0.4):
- Deep OOP architecture understanding
- COM automation mastery
- Regex pattern matching for citations
- Spanish APA validation logic
- LLM integration with Ollama
- Professional reporting generation

NEXT SESSION: Start v0.5 in NEW CHAT with EUMIC compliance focus
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

December 31, 2024 - SILVINA v0.5 Development - Session 3 Complete
Project: SILVINA Editorial Assistant
Hours: ~6 hours (across Sessions 1-3)
Status: v0.5 at 75% completion
Major Accomplishments:
Session 1 (Foundation):

Fixed critical COM initialization issues with Word automation
Implemented article type detection (Divulgación/Científica) using IMRyD structure analysis
Enhanced author validation to support organizational authors (Google, IBM, NIST, etc.)
Created token calculator for LLM context management (72.5% usage on test document)
Integrated RAE grammar rules as context for focused LLM review

Session 2 (Refinement):

Resolved LLM hallucination issues through improved prompt engineering
Achieved clean grammar validation: "No se detectaron errores gramaticales" without false positives
Eliminated unwanted style suggestions and generic advice from LLM output
Optimized response length (500 tokens) to prevent cutoffs

Session 3 (Validation Enhancement):

Implemented alphabetical order checking for references
Added Spanish APA 7 conjunction validation ("y" vs "&")
Successfully detected 3 instances of incorrect "&" usage in test document
Enhanced reporting with detailed validation breakdown

Technical Metrics:

Character count accuracy: 99.7% vs Word
Reference validation: 8/8 extracted, 5/8 fully compliant
LLM response time: ~30 seconds
No false positives on organizational author detection

Known Issues:

Regex pattern for "&" detection needs minor refinement for comma handling (reference #8)
Reference #7 has legitimate formatting error (year not in parentheses)

Next Steps (Session 4):

DOI/URL presence detection
Duplicate reference detection
Bibliografia vs Referencias section identification

Learning Outcomes:

Advanced COM automation with defensive programming
LLM prompt engineering for constrained tasks
Complex regex patterns for Spanish language validation
Token estimation for context window management
Git workflow for incremental feature development

Course Progress:

Month 2 of 7-month Python + AI Agent Development course
CS50 Python prerequisite completed
On track for March 2026 goal (June 2026 hard deadline)
