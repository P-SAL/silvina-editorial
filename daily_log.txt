=== SESSION: Dec 13, 2025 - v0.4 Reference Class ===

MILESTONE: First OOP class for Silvina - Reference class working!

COMPLETED:
- Created silvina_editorial_v0.4.py
- Built Reference class with:
  * __init__ stores citation text
  * validate_author() checks format
  * validate_year() checks format
  * is_valid() combines all checks
  * get_validation_report() returns detailed results
- Tested with 7 different references
- All validations working correctly

LEARNED:
- How to create a class with __init__
- self references the current object instance
- Objects carry their own data
- Methods operate on object's own data
- Testing shows: 5/7 validated correctly

KEY INSIGHT:
OOP makes code cleaner:
- v0.3: validate_author_pattern(text) - pass data
- v0.4: reference.validate_author() - object knows its data

WORKING:
- Multiple authors with "y"
- Compound surnames (Pérez-Sánchez)
- Spanish characters (á, é, ñ)
- Year extraction from (YYYY)

NEXT SESSION:
- Build Document class (loads from Word)
- Build APAValidator class (validation rules)
- Integrate all classes together
- Start NEW CHAT with updated course prompt

THINKPAD: C:\00 PY\Course - venv312 active
STATUS: Reference class complete, committed to GitHub

=== SESSION: Dec 19, 2025 - v0.4 Reference Class Testing ===

COMPLETED:
- Successfully tested Reference class on ThinkPad
- Validated with 7 different references (5 valid, 2 invalid)
- Regex patterns working perfectly:
  * Multiple authors with "y"
  * Compound surnames (Pérez-Sánchez)
  * Spanish characters (á, é, ñ)
  * Year extraction from (YYYY)
- Committed v0.4 Reference class to GitHub

LEARNED:
- OOP in practice - objects carry their own data
- Each Reference validates itself
- Methods like validate_author() work on self.text
- get_validation_report() returns structured data

WORKING ON THINKPAD:
- Location: C:\00 PY\Course\silvina-editorial
- venv312 active and working
- Git synced with GitHub

ISSUES RESOLVED:
- VS Code Explorer not showing files → Fixed by opening folder with "code ."
- daily_log.txt visibility → Was in wrong directory

NEXT SESSION:
- Build Document class (loads from Word)
- Build APAValidator class (validation rules)
- Start NEW CHAT with updated course prompt

STATUS: Reference class complete ✅, ready for Document class
